I may Update this documentation every once in a while so keep an eye on it.
Here soon I'll upload my community server for like minded peeps.

>> Just some Info cuz description is too small for this stuff

Here , the Levels is all about the Server size so it would be easier for you guys to understand this stuff.

   - Level 1 : 0 - 30 members
   > { Level 1 } is all about small personal servers and not made for communities.

   - Level 2 : 30 - 200 members
   > { Level 2 } is all about having a good small friends community but not a public one.

   - Level 3 : 200 - 1000 members
   > { Level 3 } is all about having a small public community, like a youtuber's new discord server.

   - Level 4 : 1000+ members
   > { Level 4 } Here you don't really need a template now, just upgrade the level 3 servers you have with your moderators and Admins. If you dont have one then get some mods and admins for your server.
